Weather Forecaster is a simple basic weather dashboard that shows the weather outlook for multiple cities depending on user input. It was build using the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API, as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).
